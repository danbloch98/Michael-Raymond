                <h1>PANCAKE THOMAS</h1>
                <p>Cleveland “Pancake” Thomas was one of the inaugural business and marketing clients for Raymond Representation. Thomas is a 6’4 shooting guard out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he played his high school ball at Scottlandville Magnet High School. He was an impressive four-year starter during his high school career with the Hornets having averaged 17.5 ppg as a junior and 20.1 ppg as a senior where he led his team to a 36-2 record and a Louisiana State title as well. Following his high school years, Thomas was rated a 2-Star recruit and proved all doubters wrong. He played his first two collegiate seasons for the University of New Mexico Lobos where he averages 2.5 ppg and 1.6 rpg. Pancake then transferred to the University of Hartford where he played for the Hawks where he absolutely exploded for a career-high of 18.7 ppg and 6.5 rpg. Thomas then finished off his NCAA career at Western Kentucky University for the Hilltoppers where he put up 13.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, and 2.6 apg.                 </p>
