                <h1>ERIC AYALA</h1>
                <p>Ayala came to the Raymond Representation family on a Name, Image, and Likeliness deal. Ayala was a four-star prospect coming out of IMG Academy in Florida and the #10 recruit in the entire state in 2018. Ayala had more than 25 scholarship offers after his high school career was over and committed to the University of Maryland where he stepped into a leadership role almost immediately having started 33 games as a freshman. Over his three seasons thus far for the Terrapins, he has averaged 10.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg and, and 2.3 apg. He is coming off of a breakout season during his junior year where he put up 15.1 ppg, 4.3 rpg, and 2.2 apg. In 2021, he also earned a spot on the USBWA All-District Team and received an honorable mention for the All-Big 10 team.</p>
